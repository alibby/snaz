== Introduciton

This is a small app to demonstrate some of the features of Sunspot. It was 
created to use as a demonstration app for a talk on Solr and Rails.

The application has a Document model and DocumentsController.  The Documents 
are RFCs.  An archive of all of the RFCs and an XML index of them is downloadable
from xforty.com.  

Attempts have been made to get the app running easily.  

== Setups

o Install gems "sudo rake gems:install"

o Init db "rake db:migrate"

o Download the RFCs and the RFC index by running "rake snaz:download_data"

o Start solr "rake sunspot:solr:run"

o Load the data into the DB and Solr "rake snaz:load_documents"

The first and third step both take quite a while.  

=== Persnickety Sunspot.  

Sunspot needs the following to install/ run:

o rsolr - sudo gem install rsolr --source=http://gemcutter.org
o optiflag version 0.6.5 exactly - sudo gem instlal optiflag -v 0.6.5
o haml 2.2.10 - sudo gem install haml

With those on board, the Sunspot gems would finally install

sudo gem install outoftime-sunspot --source=http://gems.github.com
sudo gem install outoftime-sunspot-rails --source=http://gems.github.com

Retrieved XML RFC index and RFCs from http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc.html

The whole archive was downloaded from ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/tar/RFC-all.tar.gz
