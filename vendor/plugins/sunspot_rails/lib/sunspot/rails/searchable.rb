module Sunspot #:nodoc:
  module Rails #:nodoc:
    # 
    # This module adds Sunspot functionality to ActiveRecord models. As well as
    # providing class and instance methods, it optionally adds lifecycle hooks
    # to automatically add and remove models from the Solr index as they are
    # created and destroyed.

      module ActsAsMethods
        # 
        # Makes a class searchable if it is not already, or adds search
        # configuration if it is. Note that the options passed in are only used
        # the first time this method is called for a particular class; so,
        # search should be defined before activating any mixins that extend
        # search configuration.
        #
        # The block passed into this method is evaluated by the
        # <code>Sunspot.setup</code> method. See the Sunspot documentation for
        # complete information on the functionality provided by that method.
        #
        # ==== Options (+options+)
        # 
        # :auto_index<Boolean>::
        #   Automatically index models in Solr when they are saved.
        #   Default: true
        # :auto_remove<Boolean>::
        #   Automatically remove models from the Solr index when they are
        #   destroyed. <b>Setting this option to +false+ is not recommended
        #   </b>(see the README).
        # :ignore_attribute_changes_of<Array>::
        #   Define attributes, that should not trigger a reindex of that
        #   object. Usual suspects are update_at or counters.
        #
        # ==== Example
        #
        #   class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
        #     searchable do
        #       text :title, :body
        #       string :sort_title do
        #         title.downcase.sub(/^(an?|the)/, '')
        #       end
        #       integer :blog_id
        #       time :updated_at

        # the Sunspot.search method - see the Sunspot documentation for the full
        # API.
        #
        # ==== Example
        #
        #   Post.search do
        #     keywords 'best pizza'
        #     with :blog_id, 1

        # the database. This method may be useful if search is used as an
        # intermediate step in a larger find operation. The block is the same
        # as the block provided to the #search method.

        # +batch_size+ argument specifies how many records to load out of the
        # database at a time. The default batch size is 500; if nil is passed,
        # records will not be indexed in batches. By default, a commit is issued
        # after each batch; passing +false+ for +batch_commit+ will disable
        # this, and only issue a commit at the end of the process. If associated
        # objects need to indexed also, you can specify +include+ in format 
        # accepted by ActiveRecord to improve your sql select performance
        #
        # ==== Options (passed as a hash)
        #
        # batch_size<Integer>:: Batch size with which to load records. Passing
        #                       'nil' will skip batches.  Default is 500.
        # batch_commit<Boolean>:: Flag signalling if a commit should be done after
        #                         after each batch is indexed, default is 'true'
        # include<Mixed>:: include option to be passed to the ActiveRecord find,
        #                  used for including associated objects that need to be
        #                  indexed with the parent object, accepts all formats
